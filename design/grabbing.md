# Grabbing direction

## Grab direction
Hands should try to reach a destination using inverse kinematics.
Basic grabbing should just be pointing out from the camera.

## Twist
We need to give the players more manipulation possibilities.
Let the user freeze their camera in place with LShift and then
rotate the object in their hands currently along a pole that makes
intuitive sense.

## Magnets
Pull towards specific parts of objects?
