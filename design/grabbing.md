# Grabbing direction

## Grab direction
Hands should try to reach a destination using inverse kinematics.
Basic grabbing should just be pointing out from the camera.

## Twist
We need to give the players more manipulation possibilities.
Let the user freeze their camera in place with LShift and then
rotate the object in their hands currently along a pole that makes
intuitive sense.

## Magnets
Pull towards specific parts of objects, currently defined as 
the simple points/lines so we can get the closest point on 
the "magnet" and then pull the hand in that direction.

Maybe should have an repulsion from the other hand on some objects for a better grip for twisting.
