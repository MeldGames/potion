## Beginning
Player starts in the locked cellar of their former master who was 
taken away by Jeff Baebos.

Learns how to grab ingredients and add them to a static cauldron 
in the cellar and the basics of brewing potions with a stick.
Only have the ingredients to create a potion of exploding, so you
end up hurting yourself to blast open the wall of the cellar to
escape. Upon escape, the player is given the option to do
whatever they wish.  Progression will be locked behind crafting 
potions to complete specific tasks.

## Episode 1: Coming to grips
First progression will largely be based around learning movement,
gaining intuition for grabbing things, as well as simple 
crushing/brewing of potions.

Zones:
* Prallet Plains
    - Largely open area with vegetation, trees, berries, and
    prallet grasses.
    - This is the immediate zone you will see upon breaking out
    of your mentors home.
* Gemcrushed hill
    - A slightly more difficult to traverse area with gem rocks
    to gather.
    - This will serve as an introduction into climbing.
* Townton
    - Small town that will sell you a cart for storage as well
    as ask you for various potions in exchange for other goods
    or money.
